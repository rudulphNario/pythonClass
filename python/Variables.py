# variable naming conventions = how you can make a variable
# 1. you csn write any alphabet lowercase and uppercase in the variable
# example: num, number string, megan, urvashi, UVRASHI
# 2. Numbers can be added in a variable but not in the first place
# example: megan45, go457tu,
# 45tyu --> this is wrong
# comments = that part of code which is not executed by python and python ignores it

# m = "Megan"
# print(m)

# M = "Megan"
# print(M)

# number = 34
# print(number)

# m23 = "Megan"
# print(m23)

# m45M = "Megan"
# print(m45M)

# number% = 34
# print(number%)

# number^ = 56
# print(number^)

# num^ber = 4

# number_ = 23
# print(number_)

# _number = 4

# num_ber = 5

# 1. you can write any alphabet including Lowercase and uppercase in the variable
# example: num, number, string, megan, uvrashi, UVRASHI
# 2. numbers can be added in a variable but not at the first place
# example: megan45, go457tu
# 3. symbols are not allowed in the variable except _(underscore)
# example: num_, _num, n_um
# 45tyu --> this is wrong
# 4. spaces are not allowed in the variable
# example: nu m --> this is wrong

# a = 1

# we can assign valued to multiple variables in a single line like this:
# a, b, c, = 1, 2, 4

# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)

# a = b = c = 1
# print(a)
# print(b)

# we can print multiple variables in a single line using commas (,)
# a = 3
# b = 4
# c = 7

# print(a, b, c)

# a = 3 
# b = 4
# c = 7

# print(a + b + c)

# num = 34
# name = "Megan"

# it will give error
# we cannot add a string with a number
